Output: A web or app interface where users can converse with the chatbot.
Deliverables:
For the final project submission, it is required to use GitHub. Ensure that you will create a dedicated repository for your project and use this for all your submissions. Embracing this approach will not only streamline our assessment process but will also equip you with a vital skill set valued in the tech industry.
Your submission within Canvas will contain the following deliverables:
1.	A link to the final project's GitHub repository.  
2.	A working generative chatbot accessible via Notebook and/or accessible through a web interface (include the link in your submission and report). Your Notebook should be in PDF or HTML format.
3.	A brief report in PDF detailing:
•	Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
•	Model architecture and rationale behind the chosen design.
•	Evaluation results and user feedback.
•	Future improvements and scalability options.
•	Write and submit your final project report in APA 7 style (sample professional paper Download sample professional paper). The final report (without Appendices), including text and selected tables/graphs, should be 3-5 pages. You will use the naming convention Final Project Report-Team Number.pdf (e.g., Final Project Report-Team 1.pdf).
4.	Presentation: For the completion of your final project, students will be required to prepare and record a presentation Download record a presentationthat unfolds in the form of a captivating story, detailing their development, findings, and any relevant recommendations or conclusions. Visuals are required in the video presentation, which should be 5-7 minutes. A Demo of your chatbot and how it works is recommended.

Since this presentation is a narrated presentation, it is a best practice to create a script beneath each slide in speaker notes if in PowerPoint or on an external document if screen capturing using other software. The scripts will help you when recording the narration.
